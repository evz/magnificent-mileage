# Magnificent Mileage

### What is this?

This is a copy of the [Open Trip Planner](https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner) patform. It is for transit routing in the city of Chicago.

The idea is to make a free, Chicago-specific routing website and API for developers to build transit apps on top of.

#### A website

#### An API for transit routing

Example API call
```bash
curl --header "Accept: application/json" http://ec2-54-227-63-227.compute-1.amazonaws.com/opentripplanner-api-webapp/ws/plan \
?mode=TRANSIT%2CWALK \

&maxWalkDistance=840 \
&walkSpeed=1.341 \
&date=2013-08-13 \
&toPlace=41.823781%2C-87.613907 \
&fromPlace=41.900999%2C-87.696304
```
